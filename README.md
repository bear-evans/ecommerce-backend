## Installation

The easiest way to install Grizzly E-Commerce is to clone this repository using
the following command.

```
git@github.com:bear-evans/ecommerce-backend.git
```

Once downloaded, you can install its dependencies by navigating to the
application's directory and issuing the following command.

```
npm install
```

This will install `express`, `mysql2`, `sequelize`, and `dotenv`.

A database schema and a seed file are included for convenience. To load the
schema, initialize mysql from the command line in the application's directory
and run

```
mysql> source db/schema.sql;
```

To seed the database, use the command

```
npm run seed
```

from the application's root directory.

Additionally, you will need to add a .env file specifying your username,
password, and host for the MySQL connection. A template has been provided.

```
node server.js
```

from the app's directory.
